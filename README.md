• Startup Functionality(injector,Disabling certain apps like SystemSettings.exe by ending process, other malware capabilities)

• Cryptojacking(Btc address swapper, downloading crypto miner,probably xmrig, on victims computer)
• better configuration (Script editor that doesn't require manual editing)

• Edit the local drive (C:/) and overwrite the MBR(This will wipe the users system, super illegal and dangerous if accidentally ran)

• Botnet functionality(Crypto mining, control  the botnet using webserver/website, probably using a replit webserver, i have made a 
working prototype with ddos, screenshots, and cmd commands. I am using replit webserver as it is easier to control many co.puters by 
sending commands that they will read deom teh web. Using a vpn and temp mail will hide your info from replit.com so you cant be traced)

• Backdoor/rat functionality(will use the same replit webserver, but will have more specific commands for cmd prompt and powershell, 
and more features like mic record etc)

• Self DDOS(Will try and run a ddos script on the victims pc ip address, This will hopefully make their router unusable, without any traceback to you)

• Rootkit Functionality(Using Ctypes and the Windows API, this means you can execute commands like changing the users windows password(basic), or renaming Crucial system files)

• Keylogger?

• Minecraft session id cookie

• %APPDATA% cloner?

• File Stealer with certain keywords, ie. My passwords.txt?

• Worm Functionality?

• Ransomware feature?

• Reverse shell backdoor?

• Anti-Virtual Machine

• Obfuscation/F.U.D (This will jumble up the code, and make it unreadable, meaning its practically impossible for someone to get your webhook url and crypto wallets from the exe, if they even manage to decompile it.)

• Disable windows defender 

• Fake error popup

• fake BSOD;) if u really want it(not recommended as victim will know something is wrong)

• anything else (msg me on discord at chickenpie8636)

Question marks are a maybe btw, or not needed at the momenm
